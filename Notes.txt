Compelete binary tree is called when all left node are filled accordingly and perfect binary tree is called when every node has exactly 2 children and all level fillup.

Array representation of complete binary tree-

i->left = i*2+1
i->right = i*2+2
i->parent = (i-1)/2

It must need to be compelete binary tree or perfect

What is heap?
- Heap is the array representation of a complete binary tree.

two types of heap-
1. Max heap - parent will be greater than children, always give max value
2. Min heap - parent will be less than children, always give min value
